        <h3>List of skills and tallents</h3>
        <p>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express
          yourself to others through painting. Almost everything is going to
          happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time
          working or worrying. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always
          looks for the easiest way to do things I started painting as a hobby
          when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is
          just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. We must be quiet,
          soft and gentle.</p>
        <p>We'll play with clouds today. Here's another little happy bush Do an
          almighty painting with us. When you buy that first tube of paint it
          gives you an artist license. Now we can begin working on lots of happy
          little things.</p>
